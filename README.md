#  Course Registration Portal (C++)

A console-based **Course Registration System** built in **C++** that simulates a real-world college course registration workflow.  
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, and **modular design** using multiple source/header files.

---

##  Features

###  Student Module
- Student **Registration** (creates and stores user data in `students.csv`)
- Student **Login** (authenticates via email & password)
- **View Available Courses**
- **Enroll / Drop Courses**
- **View Enrolled Courses**
- **Generate Enrollment Slip** (saved in `data/slips/`)

###  Faculty / Admin Module
- **Add New Courses**
- **View All Courses**
- **View System Report**
- **Save Report to File** (`data/reports/admin_report.txt`)

###  Admin Report Includes:
- Total number of registered students
- Total available courses
- Total enrollments
- Enrollment count per course

##  Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++17
- **Concepts:** Classes, Inheritance, File I/O, Encapsulation, Modular Programming
- **Compiler:** MinGW / g++
- **IDE (optional):** Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install **MinGW** or any C++ compiler supporting C++17.
- Add compiler path to system environment variables.
- Install **VS Code** (recommended) with the C++ extension.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CourseRegistrationPortal.git
cd CourseRegistrationPortal
```

### 3. Create Folder Structure
Ensure these directories exist:
```
data/
├── students.csv
├── courses.csv
├── enrollments.csv
├── slips/
└── reports/
```

### 4. Initialize CSV Files
Create these empty files (with headers):
```csv
# students.csv
id,name,email,password

# courses.csv
course_id,title,credits,faculty,seats

# enrollments.csv
enroll_id,student_id,course_id,timestamp
```

### 5. Build & Run
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 src\*.cpp -Iinclude -o build\app.exe
build\app.exe
```

##  Key Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Classes & Objects** | Modeled entities like Student, Course, Enrollment |
| **Inheritance** | Student inherits from User |
| **File Handling** | Data persistence using CSV files |
| **Encapsulation** | Private data members with public methods |
| **Modular Design** | Code divided into multiple source and header files |
